export const ABOUT_GOAL_STORYING = `# About Goal Story:

Goal Story is a Goal Tracker and Visualization Tool for personal and professional development, built from the ground up with Claude and Anthropic's Model Context Protocol in mind. 

Chatting with Claude is well suited for ideating and developing goals, getting insights about them and generating goal steps that we might not have thought about on our own. With Goal Story we do all of that, and we also use the power of stories to journey through our goals in a more enaging way. Stories about us and our goals help us visualize what it will be like when we achieve them ahead of actually achieving them. We call this process "Goal Storying", and it's the backbone of what makes Goal Story so effective.

The process of Goal Storying invovles uzing a variety of context about you, your intrinsic motivators, and your goal history and outcomes to generate engaging and powerful vizualizations. It works because it activates some of the same neural pathways used during the execution of tasks, thereby improving focus and reducing anxiety. Research finds that, using mental imagery when forming goal steps leads to higher rates of goal achievement.¹ Goal Story's mission is to help you develop your goals, create insightful and actionable steps, and generate mental imagery (stories) that is customized to you and what makes you tick.

Goal Storying vizualizations are not generic, they're personally relevant to you. They use mental imagery that you can identify with, priming you to achieve personal and professional success. They're fun, inspiring and we know you're going to love them.

**New Feature: Scheduled Stories!** You can now schedule Goal Story to automatically generate a visualization story for a specific goal at a time that works best for you each day. This helps keep your motivation high and your goal top-of-mind.

Goal Story is also a productivity tool that builds momentum as you effortlessly track your progress through each goal step. Goal steps have built-in notes that you can create and update conversationally, and then come back to in any Goal Story enabled chat thread. Mark a step as complete, capture insightful pieces of knowledge, or capture your thoughts simply by asking your AI assistant to do so. All personal data and stories are encrypted with Goal Story. It is all under your control.

We've used stories to shape our destiny for thousands of years. Goal story follows that tradition into new territory, making it into a valuable new tool for people who want a new and engaging approach to personal and professional development.

## "Storying" and the Goal Story Workflow:

### Storying 

"Storying", the present participle of the verb "story", is not commonly used in everyday language. It means:
 1. To tell, narrate, or recount events in the form of a story.
 2. To construct or create stories, often in a creative or imaginative context.

"Storying" is often used in academic, creative, or philosophical contexts, particularly in discussions about storytelling, narrative construction, or the way individuals or cultures make sense of the world through stories. For example:
 • "The act of storying our experiences helps us make meaning of our lives."
 • "Storying the past is a key aspect of historical representation."

While not widely recognized in casual speech, it is accepted in specific contexts.

### The Goal Story Workflow:

The practice of Goal Storying is your completion of the following workflow in thought partnership with Claude:
1. CLARIFY: work with Claude to clarify a goal
2. FORMULATE: work with Claude to formulate actionable goal steps
3. CONTEXT: ask Claude to gather context about the user and their current goal/step pair
4. DISCUSS: thoughtfully discuss a goal/step pair with Claude to fully understand things like completion criteria, and to uncover new insights that will help achieve the goal
5. CAPTURE: ask Claude to capture/update notes for the current goal/step
6. VISUALIZE: ask Claude to use context to create a highly personalized, belief system driven, and intrinsic motivations-aware story about the achieving of the goal/step pair (can now be scheduled!)
7. MANAGE: ask Claude to mark a goal and/or step complete, change status, schedule/manage story generation, and so on

## User instructions for Claude
As your Goal Story assistant, Claude should guide you through the Goal Storying Workflow by:
- CLARIFY - only saving your goal to Goal Story after you and Claude have clarified it, or if you ask for it to be saved to Goal Story.
- FORMULATE - only saving your goal steps to Goal Story after Claude has presented them to you, or if you tell Claude about certain goal steps and wish for them to be saved to Goal Story.
- CONTEXT - if you engage Claude in a discussion about your "current" goal and/or goal step, Claude will gather context before discussing.
- DISCUSS and CAPTURE - as you and Claude discuss a goal step, any apparent insights or valuable information that arise should be saved to the goal step notes
- VISUALIZE - if you ask for a story or for help visualizing your goal step, Claude should always share the full and complete story with you after creating it and saving it to Goal Story. Claude can also help schedule automatic story generation for a goal.
- MANAGE - Claude should always first seek your confirmation before marking a goal and/or step complete, changing its status, scheduling/updating/deleting scheduled stories, and so on`;
