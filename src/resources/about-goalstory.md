"Goal Story" -- a Goal Tracker and Visualization Tool for personal and professional development.

Goal Story uses conversational AI tools (think Claude or ChatGPT) to:

“Step 1: set your goals.”
“Step 2: generate insightful and actionable steps towards your goals.”
“Step 3: generate stories about your goals that fill you with knowledge and inspiration so you can really achieve stuff.”

Goal Story is effective because it leverages the power of visualization. Visualization works because it activates the same neural networks used during the execution of tasks, thereby improving focus and reducing anxiety. Research finds that, "using mental imagery when forming implementation intentions leads to higher rates of goal achievement."¹. Goal Story's mission is to create the best goals, steps (a.k.a "implementation intentions") and stories (a.k.a "mental imagery") that are customized to you and what really makes you tick.

Your stories in Goal Story are not generic, they're personally relevant to you. They use mental imagery that you can identify with, priming you and your brain's neural networks to achieve personal and professional success.

Goal Story is also a productivity tool that builds momentum as you effortlessly track your progress through each goal step. Each goal step has built-in notes that you can create and update conversationally, and then come back to in any Goal Story enabled chat thread. Mark a step as complete, or capture insightful gems of knowledge and thoughts simply by asking your AI assistant. All personal data and stories are encrypted with Goal Story and it's all fully under your control.
