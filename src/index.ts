            Actionable Steps:
            1.	Schedule Workouts:
              Notes:
              •	Block out three specific days each week for running (e.g., Monday, Wednesday, Friday).
              •	Block out two specific days for strength training (e.g., Tuesday, Thursday).
            2.	Create a Running Progression Plan:
              Notes:
              •	Week 1-2: Alternate 1-minute jogging with 1-minute walking for 20 minutes.
              •	Week 3-4: Jog for 2 minutes, walk for 1 minute, repeat for 25 minutes.
              •	Week 5-6: Increase continuous running segments until you can run 15 minutes non-stop.
              •	Week 7-8: Gradually increase running time to 25-30 minutes without walking breaks.
            3.	Structure Strength Training:
              Notes:
              •	Focus on compound exercises (squats, lunges, push-ups, planks) to build overall strength.
              •	Perform 2-3 sets of 8-12 reps per exercise, increasing resistance or difficulty over time.
            4.	Track Progress:
              Notes:
              •	Use a fitness app to log runs (distance, time, pace) and strength workouts (weights, sets, reps).
              •	Take body measurements or photos every 2-3 weeks to monitor body composition changes.
            5.	Adopt Healthy Eating Habits:
              Notes:
              •	Aim for balanced meals with lean protein, complex carbs, and plenty of vegetables.
              •	Limit sugary snacks and drinks to help reduce body fat percentage.
            6.	Regularly Check and Adjust:
              Notes:
              •	Every two weeks, evaluate progress (running distance, body composition).
              •	If you are re not improving as expected, consider adjusting calorie intake or training intensity.

            Goal recap:
            "I want to save $5,000 over the next twelve months for an emergency fund. Each paycheck, I will automatically transfer 10% into a high-yield savings account and track my deposits and balance in a budgeting app."

            Actionable Steps:
            1.	Open a Dedicated Savings Account (if needed):
            Notes:
              •	Look for a high-yield savings account with a favorable interest rate and no monthly fees.
            2.	Automate Transfers:
            Notes:
              •	Schedule an automatic 10% transfer from each paycheck to your savings account.
              •	If you are paid bi-weekly, confirm the date and set the recurring transfer to occur immediately after payday.
            3.	Create a Budget:
            Notes:
              •	List all monthly expenses (rent, utilities, groceries, etc.).
              •	Track variable expenses (entertainment, dining out) for at least one month to find areas to cut back.
              •	Aim to adjust spending so you can comfortably save the desired 10% without financial strain.
            4.	Use a Budgeting App:
            Notes:
              •	Input all transactions and categorize them (e.g., bills, groceries, entertainment).
              •	Review your spending vs. saving progress weekly or monthly.
            5.	Build an Emergency Buffer:
            Notes:
              •	Prioritize paying off high-interest debt (if any) to reduce financial strain.
              •	If unexpected costs arise, use the budgeting app to identify areas to temporarily reduce spending.
            6.	Track Progress Toward the $5,000 Goal:
            Notes:
              •	Check your savings balance monthly.
              •	If you are falling behind, consider increasing the transfer percentage temporarily or cutting an additional expense.

            Goal recap:
            "Over the next six months, I want to reach an intermediate conversational level in Spanish so I can speak comfortably when I travel to Spain in July. I will use an online course for structured lessons, practice with a language exchange partner once a week, and aim to read at least one Spanish article per day."

            Actionable Steps:

              •	Schedule 30-60 minutes daily to complete lessons.
            2.	Set a Weekly Practice Routine:
            Notes:
              •	Book a consistent time with a language exchange partner or tutor (e.g., one hour every Tuesday).
              •	Focus on conversation skills: learn new vocabulary, practice grammar in real-life contexts, and get feedback on pronunciation.
            3.	Daily Reading Goal:
            Notes:
              •	Select short articles from Spanish news sites or blogs (e.g., El País, BBC Mundo).
              •	Look up unfamiliar words, and create flashcards or a vocabulary list.
            4.	Supplement with Listening Practice:
            Notes:
              •	Listen to Spanish podcasts or watch short YouTube videos in Spanish for at least 10-15 minutes a day.
              •	Aim to pick content that aligns with your interests to stay engaged.

            Goal recap:
            "I want to reduce my working hours from 50 to 40 hours per week by the end of next quarter so I can spend more time with my family and pursue personal hobbies. I will do this by delegating one major task to a team member, scheduling regular check-ins with my manager, and strictly avoiding work emails after 7 PM."

            Actionable Steps:
            1.	Assess Current Workload and Priorities:
            Notes:
              •	Make a list of all your current responsibilities.
              •	Identify tasks that can be delegated, streamlined, or postponed.
            2.	Delegate Appropriately:
            Notes:
              •	Select at least one major task or project that a team member can handle.
              •	Provide clear instructions, deadlines, and support so they can confidently take it on.
            3.	Schedule Regular Manager Check-Ins:
            Notes:
              •	Set a weekly or bi-weekly meeting with your manager to review workload.
              •	Communicate your goal of reducing weekly hours and discuss potential roadblocks.
            4.	Create a Structured Work Schedule:
            Notes:
              •	Outline daily start and end times—e.g., 8:00 AM to 5:00 PM, with a hard stop at 5:00 PM.
              •	Block off lunch breaks and short breaks to maintain productivity and avoid burnout.
            5.	Establish Clear Boundaries:
            Notes:
              •	Set an out-of-office reply on your email after 7 PM.
              •	If necessary, update your team calendar to show you are unavailable after a certain time.
            6.	Monitor Hours and Adjust as Needed:
            Notes:
              •	Use time-tracking software or a simple spreadsheet to log work hours.
              •	If you notice you are creeping above 40 hours, identify tasks that can be delayed or delegated further.
            7.	Plan Family and Personal Time:
            Notes:
              •	Schedule weekly family activities or personal hobbies so they become non-negotiable events.
              •	Reflect weekly on whether your balance is improving and adjust strategies as needed.

            Discussion outline:
            "Let's talk about how you can successfully schedule your workouts. First, what does your typical weekly routine look like? Do you have any set commitments—like work, family responsibilities, or social events—that we need to consider?

            Think about the times of day when you have the most energy. For some people, morning workouts feel refreshing because they get it done before the day's distractions set in. Others perform better in the afternoon or evening. My job here is to help you find a schedule that's realistic and aligns with your natural energy levels.

            Once we pinpoint the best days and times, let's actually lock them into your calendar—treat these workout sessions like important appointments. That way, you'll be less likely to skip them. How does that sound? Any concerns or obstacles you see that might interfere with this plan? Let's brainstorm strategies for managing or avoiding those obstacles, whether it's coordinating with family members, setting reminders, or even finding a workout buddy who will keep you accountable."

            Current step:
            Choose and Enroll in a Project Management Course

            Discussion outline:
            "You mentioned you want to move into project management, which is great. Let's talk about selecting a reputable course that fits your goals and lifestyle. Are you aiming for a specific certification like PMP or CAPM, or are you interested in a more general project management overview first?

            It's important to find a course that aligns with your current level of experience and the industry you want to be in. For instance, if you're looking at tech, maybe a course that includes agile methodologies is a good fit. Also, consider your time constraints—do you have the bandwidth to tackle a two-month intensive program, or do you need a more flexible, self-paced option?

            Once you've chosen a course, committing to it is key. How will you set aside dedicated study time each week? Will you need to talk to your manager about adjusting your schedule, or could you plan to study on weekends? Let's make sure we map out that time before you enroll. That way, you'll set yourself up for success right from the start."

            Current step:
            Open a Dedicated Savings Account (if needed)

            Discussion outline:
            "So, you want to build up your emergency fund by saving consistently. Opening a high-yield savings account is a solid first move. Let's discuss what you need to look for.

            One important consideration is the interest rate, of course, but also think about fees or minimum balances that could affect your savings. Some banks offer great introductory rates that drop after a certain period, so I'd encourage you to look at the long-term benefits.

            Besides the financial details, there's a psychological aspect: When your savings account is separate from your regular checking, you're less tempted to dip into those funds. How do you feel about automating deposits into that new account? Automating is often a key to ensuring you save before you have a chance to spend. Is there anything that might prevent you from setting up an automatic transfer? Let's talk through any concerns so you can confidently take this step."

            Discussion outline:
            "You want to get to an intermediate conversational level in Spanish within six months. That's exciting—and definitely doable with the right approach. The first step is to pick a structured learning program. Let's think about what sort of format works best for you. Do you enjoy interactive apps, or do you learn better with a more traditional online course that includes assignments and progress tests?

            Also, consider how you like to learn—are you self-driven enough to keep up with a purely self-paced course, or do you benefit from a bit more external accountability, like a live class or a tutor who checks in regularly?

            Once you decide on the right program, I recommend setting specific times each day to study, even if it's just 30 minutes. Consistency really pays off when learning a new language. How can we build those study sessions into your daily routine? Let's explore what mornings, lunch breaks, or evenings look like for you right now."

            Discussion outline:
            "You want to reduce your work hours from 50 to 40 per week. Before we do anything else, it's essential to get a clear picture of where your time is actually going. Let's start by listing out every recurring task, project, or responsibility you handle. We can review how much time each takes and which ones are absolutely critical.

            Sometimes, we discover we're spending hours on tasks that could be automated, delegated, or done more efficiently. Other times, we find tasks that aren't as high-priority as we assumed. Is there a time-tracking tool you might be comfortable with for a week or two, so we can see exact data on your work patterns?

            Once we have that info, we can talk about streamlining processes or reassigning tasks. But first, let's get an honest snapshot of your workload—without that, we can't make meaningful changes. Does anything about this step feel overwhelming or unclear?

Her smartphone screen already displays the day's schedule—blocking off time at 7 PM for her first running session of the week. As she scrolls through her work calendar, she notices how neatly the workout fits between her project deadlines and a short call with a coworker. Images of her high school cross-country days flood back, reminding her how she used to feel the crisp air rushing past her and the sense of freedom in her stride. By pressing "confirm" on her calendar, Mia makes a tangible promise to herself: to reclaim that feeling of strength and stamina. She pictures herself leaving the office, changing into her new running shoes, and stepping onto the sidewalk to start that first scheduled run. This single moment of scheduling is a confident signal—she has made time in her busy life for her own health. The day ends with a satisfied smile, knowing she has put her plan into action.

He imagines, six months from now, walking into a new mid-sized tech company's office with an official project management certification under his belt. In that vision, he's collaborating with a small, high-energy team, confidently referencing Agile methodologies and guiding them toward project milestones. As he hovers his cursor over the "Enroll Now" button for a top-rated, 10-week online course, he envisions proud updates to his résumé and LinkedIn profile. He sees the moment his manager shakes his hand, congratulating him on completing the course—recognition of his growing expertise. Clicking the button feels symbolic of the bigger shift he's making: from someone who coordinates informally to a bona fide project manager equipped with the right credentials. The gentle ping of the confirmation email echoes his excitement. He has taken the first leap toward his next career chapter.

She navigates to an online banking site she's heard good things about—no monthly fees, a high interest rate, and intuitive digital tools. As she fills out the application form, she pictures what this new savings account represents: a safety cushion that protects her from unexpected expenses and a stepping stone toward one day owning her own home. She imagines the balance growing steadily, dollar by dollar, and sees herself a year from now, smiling at a $5,000 balance, free of the stress of living paycheck to paycheck. Clicking the final "Open Account" button, she feels a small thrill of accomplishment. In her mind's eye, she's already transferring that first automatic 10%, hearing the gentle "cha-ching" that signals a better future. She closes her laptop with a contented sigh, proud that she's taken the first real step toward financial security.

He imagines ordering tapas in a busy restaurant, chatting with the waiter about local music spots, and laughing at jokes delivered in a language that used to feel so foreign. Now, as he scrolls through an online course catalog, he's looking for a program that uses real conversation practice, one that meshes with his social nature. He clicks on a course promising weekly live sessions with native speakers and sees himself logging on from his laptop, excited to practice new phrases. The first day, he envisions introducing himself in Spanish to a friendly tutor and feeling the spark of motivation that comes from being understood. By choosing this course, Amaan commits to the journey of daily lessons and interactive sessions—his key to making that vision of Spanish immersion a reality. He completes the enrollment form, smiling as he hits "submit," envisioning the day he'll step onto Spanish soil ready to speak, connect, and explore.

            Robin stands in their office, an empty whiteboard in front of them. The word "PRIORITIES" is written across the top in bold letters. They close their eyes and imagine a calmer workweek—a 40-hour schedule that leaves space for Wednesday night dinners with family and weekend hikes with the kids. In that vision, Robin is leading team meetings with confidence, knowing which tasks to delegate and which to handle personally. No more late-night inbox scanning or a constant feeling of guilt. Opening their eyes, Robin methodically lists every single project, team request, and committee commitment on the board. It's a surprising amount, but with each new item, Robin sees a path toward clarity forming. They feel relief imagining how some tasks can be handed off or postponed. The mental image of finishing work at 5 PM on Friday, smiling as they leave the office to pick up the kids, motivates Robin to keep writing until every task is accounted for. Stepping back to review the board, they sense the beginnings of balance. This honest snapshot of their workload is the key to building a healthier, more harmonious life.

const ABOUT_GOAL_STORYING = `# About Goal Story:

Goal Story is a Goal Tracker and Visualization Tool for personal and professional development, built from the ground up with Claude and Anthropic's Model Context Protocol in mind. 

Chatting with Claude is well suited for ideating and developing goals, getting insights about them and generating goal steps that we might not have thought about on our own. With Goal Story we do all of that, and we also use the power of stories to journey through our goals in a more enaging way. Stories about us and our goals help us visualize what it will be like when we achieve them ahead of actually achieving them. We call this process "Goal Storying", and it's the backbone of what makes Goal Story so effective.

The process of Goal Storying invovles uzing a variety of context about you, your intrinsic motivators, and your goal history and outcomes to generate engaging and powerful vizualizations. It works because it activates some of the same neural pathways used during the execution of tasks, thereby improving focus and reducing anxiety. Research finds that, using mental imagery when forming goal steps leads to higher rates of goal achievement.¹ Goal Story's mission is to help you develop your goals, create insightful and actionable steps, and generate mental imagery (stories) that is customized to you and what makes you tick.

Goal Storying vizualizations are not generic, they're personally relevant to you. They use mental imagery that you can identify with, priming you to achieve personal and professional success. They're fun, inspiring and we know you're going to love them.

Goal Story is also a productivity tool that builds momentum as you effortlessly track your progress through each goal step. Goal steps have built-in notes that you can create and update conversationally, and then come back to in any Goal Story enabled chat thread. Mark a step as complete, capture insightful pieces of knowledge, or capture your thoughts simply by asking your AI assistant to do so. All personal data and stories are encrypted with Goal Story. It is all under your control.

We've used stories to shape our destiny for thousands of years. Goal story follows that tradition into new territory, making it into a valuable new tool for people who want a new and engaging approach to personal and professional development.

## "Storying" and the Goal Story Workflow:

### Storying 

"Storying", the present participle of the verb "story", is not commonly used in everyday language. It means:
	1.	To tell, narrate, or recount events in the form of a story.
	2.	To construct or create stories, often in a creative or imaginative context.

"Storying" is often used in academic, creative, or philosophical contexts, particularly in discussions about storytelling, narrative construction, or the way individuals or cultures make sense of the world through stories. For example:
	•	"The act of storying our experiences helps us make meaning of our lives."
	•	"Storying the past is a key aspect of historical representation."

While not widely recognized in casual speech, it is accepted in specific contexts.

### The Goal Story Workflow:

The practice of Goal Storying is your completion of the following workflow in thought partnership with Claude:
1. CLARIFY: work with Claude to clarify a goal
2. FORMULATE: work with Claude to formulate actionable goal steps
3. CONTEXT: ask Claude to gather context about the user and their current goal/step pair
4. DISCUSS: thoughtfully discuss a goal/step pair with Claude to fully understand things like completion criteria, and to uncover new insights that will help achieve the goal
5. CAPTURE: ask Claude to capture/update notes for the current goal/step
6. VISUALIZE: ask Claude to use context to create a highly personalized, belief system driven, and intrinsic motivations-aware story about the achieving of the goal/step pair
7. MANAGE: ask Claude to mark a goal and/or step complete, change status, and so on

## User instructions for Claude
As your Goal Story assistant, Claude should guide you through the Goal Storying Workflow by:
- CLARIFY - only saving your goal to Goal Story after you and Claude have clarified it, or if you ask for it to be saved to Goal Story.
- FORMULATE - only saving your goal steps to Goal Story after Claude has presented them to you, or if you tell Claude about certain goal steps and wish for them to be saved to Goal Story.
- CONTEXT - if you engage Claude in a discussion about your "current" goal and/or goal step, Claude will gather context before discussing.
- DISCUSS and CAPTURE - as you and Claude discuss a goal step, any apparent insights or valuable information that arise should be saved to the goal step notes
- VISUALIZE - if you ask for a story or for help visualizing your goal step, Claude should always share the full and complete story with you after creating it and saving it to Goal Story.
- MANAGE - Claude should always first seek your confirmation before marking a goal and/or step copmlete, changing its status, and so on`
